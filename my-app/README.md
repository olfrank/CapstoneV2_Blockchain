##Overview
### The Project
- This project is a proof of property ownership layer which tokenises a users title to a property. Before a user mints a token, they must verify the ownership of a property. In order to do this, zk-SNARKS has been implemented to create a verification system. This system proves that the user has their title to the property without revealing specific/sensitive information about the property. 
### zkSNARKs
- In this project, zkSNARKs has been implemented using ZoKrates, a toolbox for zkSNARKs on Ethereum. ZoKrates provides a higher level programming language which compiles down to the underlying constraint system and thus allows programmers to write snarks much closer to how they are used to programming. Docker has also been used to intialise and setup ZoKrates. 
### OpenSea
- Property tokens are listed on OpenSea, a decentralised marketplace used for selling digital assets on Ethereum.
